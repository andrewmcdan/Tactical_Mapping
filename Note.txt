Data to send in each packet 
    - Originating address
        - This is the address of the node that creates the original packet. Each repeating node will not change this.
    - Message sequence number. 
        - Each node will send a number that is unique to each packet from that node with every packet that originates from it.
    - Packet sequence number
        - Each message will broken up into packets that can be delivered over the air. In order to ensure that the entre packet gets
          delivered before trying to interpret the message. If part of the message is lost, the receiving node can request a retransmit. 
    - Message start / continue / end
        - For one packet messages, start and end will be OR'ed together i.e. 0xf0 || 0x0f
    
    With the above information, every packet should be unique and every message should be unique. 

Messages are made up of packets. Each message get a unique sequence number that gets transmitted in each packet. 
Packets are RH_RF95_MAX_MESSAGE_LEN (251) long. Messages can be as long as needed but data should be streamed from the source 
    in order to minimize the RAM footprint.

When receiving a packet, first check the originating address. If it is the same as the address on the receiving node, ignore the packet
    since this is a rebound from an adjacent node. 

Next check the sequence number. Each node should keep track of the last few sequence numbers from other nodes. If a duplicate sequence number
    is found, and this is the first packet of a message, ignore the message since this node has already seen this message.

Now check the packet sequence number. If we are just starting to read a message, where the message sequence number is new to this node, make
    sure the packet sequence number is 0. Also check for message start byte. Then continue listening for packets and checking message and packet sequence numbers to ensure we
    get the entire message. When we get the message end byte, interpret the message. 

Messages should contain the following info:
    - Message type
        - Location update
        - Dropped pin update
        - Request for repeater action
        - etc
    - Node list 
        - This is a list of the addresses of all the nodes this message has passed through. 
        - If this node finds its address in this list, do not retransmit
        - If this node's address is not in the list, add it and retransmit
    - The data
