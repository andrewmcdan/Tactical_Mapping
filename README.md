# Tactical Mapping Micros
This repo contains the code that runs on the microcontrollers that are part of my Tactical Mapping project. See the ReadMe.md in each section for a deatailed description of that controller's role.

### Adafruit Feather M0 + LoRa
- Facilitates communication with the LoRa radio
- Communicates with the Teensy 4.1 via serial UART

### Teensy 4.1
- Main microcontroller that facilitates communications between all the modules
- Provide UI via OLED screen with a rotary encoder for input
- Communicates with OLED via I2C
- Communicates with GPS module via serial UART
- Communicates with BLE module via serial UART

GPS and / or BLE modules may not be present in a given configuration. In the case of a beacon (which would be deployed without a person/phone nearby), there's no reason to waste power on the BLE module. For units that carry the device with them, and have an accompanying phone, the phone can provide GPS location, and thus there is no reason for there to be a GPS module. 

Each configuration runs the same code, and it is the up to the code to determine if the module is present.

## Project Status
Currently all code is alpha level / initial experimentation. Although the plan is to get this project to a fully functional state, that will depend on availability of time given my work / school schedule.
